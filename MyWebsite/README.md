This is a portfolio Website project, which, at the time of writing, took roughly 2 weeks to create, with 30 total hours of learning.

This is made using Python's library Django for the backend, and HTML as well as CSS for the frontend. 

The index.html file stored under templates has all the HTML data for the main page, and the stylev2.css file contains all the styling for the main page.

The website is (usually) running on Google Cloud Platform's virtual machine, and the domain is programmingwithali.com

The website also has a HTTPS certificate.
